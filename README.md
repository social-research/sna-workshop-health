# Social Network Analysis/Demonstration

**Emotional Well-Being and Physical Health**

University College London

July 13, 2022

## Description

This session will provide a hands-on introduction to basic network analysis tools and methods. You will follow a tutorial to conduct two types of analysis with real data:

1. Ego-network analysis of survey data with name generators.
2. Visualization and descriptive analysis of complete networks.

## Software

We will use **R** to write and run code. If you already have **R and RStudio** installed on your machine:
    1. Clone/download this repository on your computer by clicking on the green `Code` button above.
    2. Open the `.Rmd` file from the cloned repository in RStudio.

If you do not have access to or any experience with RStudio, you can simply open the .html file in your browser and follow along.

## Further Resources

The session presents an extremely cursive overview of a large interdisciplinary field of study. There are numerous books, courses, conferences, academic degree programs, and other resources for those who would like to pursue network analysis at a deeper level. Below I list three wonderful and freely available resources that I can recommend:

* Collection of literature, datasets, courses, and many other resources related to network analysis by Fran√ßois Briatte: [https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis)
* Textbook on egocentric network analysis in R by Raffaele Vacca: [https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/](https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/)
