# Social Network Analysis/Demonstration

**Emotional Well-Being and Physical Health**

University College London

July 13, 2022

## Description

This session will provide a hands-on introduction to basic network analysis tools and methods. You will follow a tutorial to conduct two types of analysis with real data:

1. Ego-network analysis of survey data with name generators.
2. Visualization and descriptive analysis of complete networks.

## Software

We will use **R** to write and run code. You have two options:

1. Use **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)** to work in the cloud via your web browser.
    1. You will need a Google account to use Colab so if you don't already have one, create it. Other than that, you do not need to install any specialized software.
    2. Open the [Colab file]() in your browser by by first clicking on the link and then on `Open with Google Colaboratory` on top of the page.
    3. Click on `Copy to Drive` to create your own copy, which you can edit and save.

2. Alternatively, if you already have **R and RStudio** installed:
    1. Clone/download this repository on your computer by clicking on the green `Code` button above.
    2. Open the `.Rmd` file from the cloned repository in RStudio.

## Further Resources

The session presents an extremely cursive overview of a large interdisciplinary field of study. There are numerous books, courses, conferences, academic degree programs, and other resources for those who would like to pursue network analysis at a deeper level. Below I list three wonderful and freely available resources that I can recommend:

* Collection of literature, datasets, courses, and many other resources related to network analysis by Fran√ßois Briatte: [https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis)
* Textbook on egocentric network analysis in R by Raffaele Vacce: [https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/](https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/)
* Tutorials on network analysis and visualization by Katya Ognyanova: [https://kateto.net/tutorials/](https://kateto.net/tutorials/)
